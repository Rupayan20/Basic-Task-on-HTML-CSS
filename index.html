            <h2>Arijit Singh</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arijit_Singh">Arijit Singh</a> (born 25 April 1987) is an Indian singer and music composer. The recipient of several accolades including a National Film Award and six Filmfare Awards, he has recorded songs in several Indian languages and has established himself as one of the leading playback singers of Bollywood.

                Singh began his career when he participated in the contemporary reality show, Fame Gurukul in 2005, but didn't receive widespread recognition before the release of "Tum Hi Ho" and "Chahun Main Ya Naa" in 2013. He was declared the most-streamed Indian artist of 2020 and 2021 by Spotify. He was the most followed Asian soloist on Spotify.</p>
            <p>Arijit Singh was born on 25 April 1987 in Jiaganj, Murshidabad, West Bengal to Kakkar Singh, a Punjabi Sikh father and Aditi Singh, a Bengali Hindu mother. His paternal family came from Lahore during the Partition. He began his music training at a very young age at home. His maternal aunt trained in Indian classical music, and his maternal grandmother used to sing. His maternal uncle played the tabla, and his mother also sang and played the tabla. He studied at Raja Bijay Singh High School and later at the Sripat Singh College, a University of Kalyani affiliate. According to him he "was a decent student, but cared more about music" and his parents decided to train him professionally. He was taught Indian classical music by Rajendra Prasad Hazari and trained in tabla by Dhirendra Prasad Hazari. Birendra Prasad Hazari taught him Rabindra Sangeet (songs written and composed by Rabindranath Tagore) and pop music. At the age of three, he started training under the Hazari brothers, and at the age of nine, he got a scholarship from the government for training in vocals in Indian classical music.

                Growing up, he listened to Mozart, Beethoven and Bengali classical music.[citation needed] He idolized musicians like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Rashid Khan, Zakir Hussain and Anand Chatterjee, and enjoyed listening to Kishore Kumar, Hemant Kumar, and Manna Dey.</p>
